# 👋 Hey, I’m Sanjana!

🎯 Data Science Adventurer | ML Tinkerer | Backend Dev on Caffeine

I build AI systems that actually *do* stuff — from GenAI agents to streaming pipelines. Currently obsessed with making machines think (or at least fake it well).

## 🚀 What I’m Building
- 🧠 **Multi-Agent AI System** with CrewAI + LangGraph — autonomous agents that reason, retrieve, and edit (fancy way of saying: AI squad with jobs)
- 🤖 **Generative AI Q&A system** for ArXiv papers using RAG
- 📈 Real-time **Stock Market Analysis** with Kafka + smart querying
- 🐦 **BirdCLEF** competition — training deep models to ID birds by sound

## 🧠 Currently Learning
- Model optimization, RL, and generative models
- AWS, Apache Kafka, Big Data workflows
- MLOps tools: Docker, Prefect, MLflow

## 🤝 Collab With Me On:
- ML/NLP agents & experiments
- MLOps + AI Deployment
- Backend APIs (FastAPI, Django)

## 🛠️ Tools I Use (and yell at lovingly)
Python, PyTorch, LangChain, CrewAI, LangGraph, Scikit-learn, FastAPI, Django, PostgreSQL, Seaborn, MATLAB, OpenCV, Postman

## 📬 Let’s Chat!

Let’s build something cool. Or cursed. I’m open.
